## Northwind Database Dashboard

This project revolves around building an interactive dashboard to summarize and analyze the Northwind Database. The Northwind Database is a sample database provided by Microsoft Access, and it represents the sales transactions and purchases of a fictional company called "Northwind Traders". 

### Project Overview
The project encompasses the following key steps:

1. **Data Loading**                      : The Northwind Database is loaded into the database management system (DBMS) of choice. This step involves importing the provided data files into the DBMS, ensuring the data is accurately represented within the database.

2. **Creating Foreign Keys**             : In order to establish relationships and connections between tables, foreign keys are created. These keys enable efficient querying and joining of tables to extract meaningful insights from the data.

3. **SQL-Based Data Analysis**           : Various questions and queries are formulated in SQL to extract valuable information and gain insights from the Northwind Database. These queries may involve retrieving specific sales or purchase records, calculating metrics, or performing aggregations.

4. **Cloud Database Upload**             : The Northwind Database, along with its enhanced schema containing foreign keys, is uploaded to a cloud-based database for accessibility and scalability. This ensures that the database and its associated data are securely stored and easily accessible for further analysis.

5. **Interactive Dashboard Development** : An interactive dashboard is built on a cloud server using appropriate tools and technologies. This dashboard acts as a visual representation of the analyzed data, providing users with a comprehensive overview of various aspects of Northwind Traders' sales transactions and supplier purchases. It allows for interactive exploration, filtering, and visualization of the data to derive actionable insights.
